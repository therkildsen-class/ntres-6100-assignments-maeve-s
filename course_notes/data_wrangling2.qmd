```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
#install.packages("skimr")
library(skimr)
```

```{r}
coronavirus <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus/master/csv/coronavirus.csv')
```
We selected only entries from the US, and then put it into a variable, then selected that subset of the data by lat, long, and province

```{r}
coronavirus_us <- filter(coronavirus, country == "US")
coronavirus_us2 <- select(coronavirus_us, -lat, -long, -province)
```

Now, we will try to use the "pipe", which takes the subset from the previous argument and uses it for the next argument, so we don't have to keep saving objects

```{r}
coronavirus |>
  filter(country == "US") |>
  select(-lat, -long, -province)
```

There is nothing about the pipe that says it has to be on different lines, it just makes it easier to see
